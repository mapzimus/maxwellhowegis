# US Fantasy Transit Network

A fantasy "unlimited funds" transit network for North America, built as a **four-tier
hierarchy** and generated end-to-end from Census data. This folder holds the **network viewer** —
a read-only interactive map of the generated network — plus the data it renders, all plain GeoJSON.

Open [`/transit/`](https://maxwellhowegis.com/transit/) (or `transit/index.html` locally) to explore.

## The four tiers

| Tier | Role | What it connects | Color |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 — HSR Hub** | Major-city high-speed-rail hubs | Tier-1 ↔ tier-1, the intercity spine | `#fbbf24` amber |
| **2 — Regional Hub** | Smaller regional connectors | Bridge tier-1 hubs down to local networks | `#a5b4fc` indigo |
| **3 — Metro / Subway** | Hyper-local neighborhood transit | Hangs off a tier-2 hub | `#34d399` green |
| **4 — Commuter Rail** | Normal-speed rail to *every* town | Reaches the towns off tier-2 hubs | `#38bdf8` sky |

A link's tier is the **less-major** of its two endpoints (`max(fromTier, toTier)`): a tier-1↔tier-1
line is HSR; a tier-1↔tier-2 line is regional; a tier-2↔tier-3 line is metro, and so on.

## Data flow

The network is **generated, not hand-drawn**: `scripts/build_towns.py` derives the towns layer
from Census files, `scripts/build_network.py` derives the four-tier network from the towns, and
the viewer renders the committed results on every visit.

```
  Census/NE sources ─▶ scripts/build_towns.py ─▶ data/towns.geojson
                                                       │
                       scripts/build_network.py ◀──────┘
                          │
                          ├─▶ data/network.json        (tiers 1-3 + edges)
                          └─▶ data/tier4_links.geojson (the commuter web)
                                        │
                                transit/index.html (viewer — tier-4 town
                                nodes render straight from towns.geojson)
```

To change the network, tweak the constants at the top of `scripts/build_network.py` and re-run it
(~20 s), or hand the GeoJSON to Claude Code — the files in `data/` are the interface.

## Using the viewer

- **T1–T4 buttons** (top) toggle each tier's nodes and lines — a functional legend. Hide metro and
  commuter to see the HSR spine; the sidebar list filters with the map, while the count badges and
  mileage always describe the full network.
- **Tier-4 towns + lines layers**: all ~33k town nodes (sized by population) and the ~43k-link
  commuter web connecting them, canvas-rendered and lazy-loaded; each layer's on/off preference
  is remembered (the T4 button drives both together).
- **Search** flies to any of the ~33k towns (`Enter` = top hit, ranked by population). Clicking a
  sidebar row or a map marker flies there too.
- **Fit view** reframes the lower 48. On phones the panel is a collapsible bottom sheet — tap the
  handle to expand; tapping a row flies the map and tucks the sheet away.

## The auto-generated network

`scripts/build_network.py` generates the entire four-tier network from the towns layer in ~20 s
(pure stdlib, deterministic — tweak the constants at the top and re-run):

| Tier | Rule | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — HSR** | pop ≥ 175k @ 60 mi spacing, connected by a **Gabriel graph** (an edge survives if no third hub sits in the circle with the edge as its diameter — connected by construction, ~4 links per hub, so California triangulates instead of chaining). Edges are densely water-sampled (every ~8 mi) with a ~12-mi coastal tolerance — LA–San Diego hugs the shore, but nothing crosses a Great Lake, the Great Salt Lake, or an open strait. **International**: 12 Canadian metros, 5 interior-Mexico metros (Monterrey, Torreón, Mexicali, Chihuahua, Hermosillo — the 60-mi spacing is a hard invariant with no exceptions, so border twins like Tijuana and Ciudad Juárez fold into their US hub), and island links — Honolulu→Los Angeles, San Juan→Miami, Anchorage→Vancouver — land at the biggest hub within 15% of the shortest crossing | **106 hubs · 179 edges**, 38,958 mi |
| **2 — Regional** | pop ≥ 25k @ 30 mi spacing, **plus** any 100k+ city outside a metro, **plus** 42 Canadian regionals, **plus coverage fill**: promote the biggest uncovered town until *every* town is within 60 mi of a hub (Canada/Mexico stop at tier 2). Connected by an **RNG mesh over all tier-1/2 hubs** — the same lens rule as the commuter web, one level up: regionals link their natural neighbors instead of chaining to a parent, dead-ends patch to ≥ 2 links, island clusters keep a single sea link (Guam→Honolulu) | **737 hubs · 1,164 links**, 84,867 mi |
| **3 — Metro** | radial urban-core subways: every 150k+ US hub gets 4–10 compass-named lines with 2–4 chained stops each (by population), and a **circle line only where ≥ 8 lines make it read as one**. Station placement is **land-aware** (Census state polygons minus Natural Earth lakes; wet stations pull inland or drop; collisions with the hub or sibling stations drop). Suburbs ≥ 15k within 18 mi (**1,644**) join at their **nearest station reachable over land** as line extensions — anchor choice and station join are water-gated, so no metro spoke crosses a bay (Redwood City no longer wires to Hayward across San Francisco Bay; bay-locked towns like Bremerton stay tier 4) | **3,426 metro nodes** |
| **4 — Commuter web** | every remaining town joins a **relative neighborhood graph** over towns + US hubs + metro satellites (promoted suburbs stay in the web — commuter rail passes through them): an edge survives only if no third point is closer to both endpoints — RNG ⊇ MST and ⊆ Delaunay, so the web reads as planar corridors with interior degree 2–4 and no crossings. Hops cap at 60 mi, longer edges are densely water-sampled (every ~6 mi, with river forgiveness), isolated clusters bridge back over dry hops ≤ 90 mi, and dead-ends take a second link only where one heads in a genuinely different direction (≥ 45°) — peninsula towns like Little Compton end cleanly instead of growing slivers. **99.7 % of towns connect to ≥ 2 neighbors**; the exceptions are true islands/edges (Catalina, Block Island, Culebra, Provincetown, Alaska bush) | **30,860 towns · 43,317 links** |

The result is one fully connected graph (4,269 nodes / 4,907 edges) written to
`data/network.json`, plus the 43,317-link commuter web in `data/tier4_links.geojson` — the
viewer loads both directly on every visit. The tier-4 town nodes render as their own toggleable
canvas layer straight from `data/towns.geojson`, with the commuter web on a second canvas
layer beneath them.

Notable data fixes made for this: consolidated cities (Washington DC, Indianapolis,
Nashville-Davidson, Louisville/Jefferson, Baton Rouge, Athens, Augusta…) enter via their Census
"(balance)"/nonfunctioning records, and three water-skewed internal points (San Francisco 34 mi
offshore near the Farallons, New Orleans, Corpus Christi) are overridden to downtown coordinates.

## Tier 4 — the "every town" base layer

Tier 4 (normal-speed commuter rail reaching every town) is too large to hand-place, so it's
**auto-seeded** from the US Census, not drawn node by node. `scripts/build_towns.py` pulls the
Census **Gazetteer Places (national)** file and writes every **incorporated place** — city, town,
village, borough — in the 50 states + DC to `transit/data/towns.geojson` as tier-4 GeoJSON points.

- **33,288 towns** (2024 gazetteer): 10,219 cities · 5,277 towns · 3,728 villages · 1,215 boroughs
  · 12,820 CDPs (unincorporated communities, included by default; `--no-cdp` to exclude) · 29 consolidated
  governments and other types · Guam's
  19 villages seeded from the 2020 Census. New England towns come from the **county-subdivisions
  gazetteer** (they're minor civil divisions, not places — New Hampshire alone has 221 MCD towns
  vs. 13 incorporated cities), deduped against same-name places nearby. CDP populations come from
  the 2020 Census (TIGERweb), with a one-to-one Natural Earth backfill as a residual fallback.
- Every **incorporated place** is joined to Census population (SUB-EST 2024 place-level
  estimates, 100% by GEOID) and every **CDP** to its 2020 Census count (TIGERweb `POP100`) —
  **98.5% of towns carry a population**; the remaining nulls are places defined after the 2020
  Census. This is what lets 100k+ unincorporated suburbs (The Woodlands TX, Arlington VA) join
  the network's tier cuts instead of hiding as tiny dots. The `pop` property drives dot
  size/opacity in the viewer and search ranking.
- Rendered in the viewer as a canvas-drawn dot layer (**sized by population**) with a
  **"Tier-4 towns" toggle** in the sidebar — these are the tier-4 nodes themselves; the
  search box flies to any of them. Their connecting lines (the commuter web) render on a
  separate canvas layer with its own **"Tier-4 lines" toggle**.
- Rebuild / re-vintage:

  ```bash
  python3 scripts/build_towns.py                 # places + CDPs + NE MCD towns (default)
  python3 scripts/build_towns.py --no-cdp         # incorporated places only
  python3 scripts/build_towns.py --year 2023      # pin a gazetteer vintage
  ```

  The raw gazetteer + estimates files are cached under `scripts/.cache/` (gitignored); only
  `towns.geojson` is committed. Each town carries `name`, `type`, `st`, `geoid`, `pop`, `tier:4` —
  enough to auto-route commuter lines from towns to their nearest regional hub later.
  (`--no-pop` skips the population join.)

## Data schema (`fantasy-transit-v1`)

A single GeoJSON `FeatureCollection`. **Nodes** are `Point` features, **links** are `LineString`
features, distinguished by `properties.kind`:

```jsonc
// node
{ "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [lng, lat] },
  "properties": { "kind": "node", "id": "n1", "name": "New York",
                  "tier": 1, "tierName": "HSR Hub", "parent": null } }

// link
{ "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [[lng,lat],[lng,lat]] },
  "properties": { "kind": "edge", "id": "e1", "from": "n1", "to": "n3",
                  "tier": 1, "tierName": "HSR Hub" } }
```

`parent` (optional) lets a lower-tier node record which hub it hangs off, if you want the hierarchy
made explicit beyond the drawn links.

## Stack

Single self-contained `index.html` — Leaflet 1.9 + keyless CARTO dark basemap, no build step, no
API keys. The 33k-point tier-4 town layer is canvas-rendered in its own pane for smooth pan/zoom.
`scripts/build_towns.py` (Python stdlib only) regenerates the town data. Matches the rest of the
site (plain HTML/CSS/JS).
